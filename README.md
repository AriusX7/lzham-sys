# lzham-sys

Low level Rust FFI bindings for [lzham codec] generated using [`bindgen`].

You must have `cmake` and a C++ compiler to build this crate, as the [lzham] library is built along with the crate. The crate does not search for a prebuilt library.

## Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
lzham-sys = "0.1.0"
```

## Linking

`lzham-sys` supports both static and dynamic linking. To link statically, you can either set `LIBLZHAM_STATIC` or `LZHAM_STATIC` environment variables to true, or use the `static` feature.

To link dynamically, use the `dynamic` feature.

If you don't set any environment variables or use any features, the build will be the expected default library linking method based on OS or target. For Windows, macOS and Linux with musl, it will be `static`. For Linux without musl, it will be `dynamic`.

Note that environment variables take precedence over features. In case of any ambiguity, it uses the default linking method.

## Features

The crate has the following three features:

- `generate_bindings`: Generates the bindings again (uses [`bindgen`])
- `static`: Links to the library statically
- `dynamic`: Links to the library dynamically
